# Task ID: 24
# Title: Develop Comprehensive API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 23
# Priority: low
# Description: Build RESTful API with versioning, authentication, error handling, and OpenAPI documentation
# Details:
Organize API routes in src/api/v1/ with separate modules per resource. Implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens. Add request validation using Pydantic models. Create comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions. Implement rate limiting per endpoint with different tiers. Add request/response logging with correlation IDs. Generate OpenAPI documentation with examples and schemas. Create health check endpoints for each service dependency. Implement API versioning strategy with deprecation notices. Add CORS configuration for frontend integration.

# Test Strategy:
Test all CRUD operations for each resource. Verify JWT authentication and authorization. Test rate limiting with burst requests. Validate OpenAPI schema generation. Test error responses with various failure scenarios.
