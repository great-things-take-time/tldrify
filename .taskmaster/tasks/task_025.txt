# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Testing Suite and Benchmarking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24
# Priority: low
# Description: Create comprehensive test coverage with pytest, performance benchmarks, and CI/CD integration
# Details:
Setup pytest with fixtures for database, Redis, and API client. Create unit tests achieving 80% code coverage. Implement integration tests for complete workflows. Add performance benchmarks in tests/benchmarks/ for OCR speed, embedding generation, and RAG queries. Create load testing with Locust for concurrent users. Implement OCR accuracy testing with ground truth PDFs. Setup GitHub Actions for CI/CD with test automation. Add pre-commit hooks for code quality (black, ruff, mypy). Create test data generators for various document types. Implement contract testing for API endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Run full test suite in under 5 minutes. Verify code coverage meets 80% target. Test performance benchmarks meet SLA requirements. Validate CI/CD pipeline catches breaking changes. Ensure all quality checks pass before merge.
