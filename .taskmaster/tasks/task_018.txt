# Task ID: 18
# Title: Integrate Surya OCR with Fallback Mechanisms
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Surya OCR for text extraction with PyMuPDF fallback for simple PDFs and confidence scoring
# Details:
Create OCR service in src/core/ocr/surya.py using surya-ocr library. Implement page-by-page processing with PIL for image conversion. Add confidence scoring per page and per document. Create fallback to PyMuPDF for text-based PDFs in src/core/ocr/processor.py. Implement OCR result caching in Redis to avoid reprocessing. Add language detection using langdetect for Korean/English. Create post-processing pipeline for text cleaning, removing artifacts, fixing common OCR errors. Implement parallel processing for multi-page documents using asyncio. Add OCR progress tracking with Celery task updates.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark OCR accuracy on test PDFs with ground truth. Test language detection on multilingual documents. Verify fallback mechanism triggers correctly. Test confidence scoring accuracy. Measure processing speed against 5 seconds/page target.
