# Task ID: 20
# Title: Setup Qdrant Vector Database
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure Qdrant for vector storage with collections, indexing strategies, and hybrid search capabilities
# Details:
Deploy Qdrant using Docker with persistent volume for data. Create vector client in src/db/vector.py with connection pooling. Design collection schema with 1536 dimensions for text-embedding-3-large. Configure HNSW index with ef_construction=128, m=16 for optimal performance. Implement collection versioning for embedding model updates. Add metadata filtering for document_id, language, section_type. Setup backup strategy with scheduled snapshots. Implement collection aliases for blue-green deployments. Add monitoring metrics for search latency and index size.

# Test Strategy:
Test vector insertion and retrieval accuracy. Benchmark search performance with 100K+ vectors. Verify metadata filtering works correctly. Test collection backup and restore. Validate index performance under concurrent queries.
