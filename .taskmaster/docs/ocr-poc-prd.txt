# TLDRify OCR-POC Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Build a proof-of-concept for an intelligent PDF processing pipeline that demonstrates the complete flow from PDF upload to RAG-based question answering. The system will focus on accurate text extraction, semantic understanding, and intelligent retrieval.

## Core Objective
Implement and validate the technical feasibility of the OCR → Embedding → Vector DB → RAG pipeline with production-ready quality metrics.

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure
- Setup FastAPI backend with proper project structure and dependency management
- Configure PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM for document metadata storage
- Implement Redis for caching and session management
- Setup Docker containers for development environment
- Create basic health check and monitoring endpoints

### Phase 2: PDF Processing Pipeline
- Implement chunked file upload system supporting PDFs up to 100MB
- Integrate Surya OCR for multilingual text extraction
- Build fallback mechanism using PyMuPDF for simple PDFs
- Create text post-processing pipeline for cleaning and normalization
- Implement confidence scoring for OCR quality assessment

### Phase 3: Text Processing and Chunking
- Develop semantic chunking algorithm with 1000-2000 token chunks
- Implement overlap strategy to maintain context between chunks
- Extract document structure metadata (chapters, sections, headings)
- Build language detection system for multilingual support
- Create chunk indexing system with parent-child relationships

### Phase 4: Embedding Generation
- Integrate OpenAI text-embedding-3-large model
- Implement batch processing for efficient embedding generation
- Build embedding cache system to avoid redundant API calls
- Create dimension reduction options for storage optimization
- Implement embedding versioning for model updates

### Phase 5: Vector Database Integration
- Setup Qdrant vector database with Docker
- Design collection schema for document embeddings
- Implement hybrid search combining vector similarity and BM25
- Create metadata filtering for targeted searches
- Build index management system for performance optimization

### Phase 6: RAG Implementation
- Develop context retrieval system with relevance scoring
- Implement query expansion for better retrieval accuracy
- Build prompt engineering templates for different query types
- Create response generation with source citations
- Implement conversation memory for multi-turn interactions

### Phase 7: API Development
- Design RESTful API endpoints for all operations
- Implement async processing with Celery for long-running tasks
- Create WebSocket support for real-time progress updates
- Build comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- Generate OpenAPI documentation with examples

### Phase 8: Testing and Validation
- Create comprehensive test suite with pytest
- Implement OCR accuracy benchmarking system
- Build retrieval accuracy measurement tools
- Create performance profiling for bottleneck identification
- Develop end-to-end integration tests

## Success Criteria
- OCR accuracy > 95% on standard academic PDFs
- Text extraction speed < 5 seconds per page
- Embedding generation < 2 seconds per chunk
- RAG query response time < 3 seconds
- Retrieval accuracy > 85% for relevant chunks
- System handles 10 concurrent users without degradation
- 99% uptime during testing period

## Technical Constraints
- Must support Korean and English languages
- Must handle scanned PDFs with varying quality
- Must work within OpenAI API rate limits
- Must maintain data privacy and security standards
- Must be deployable on standard cloud infrastructure

## Deliverables
- Fully functional OCR-POC backend API
- Docker compose setup for local development
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Performance benchmark reports
- Test coverage report > 80%
- Deployment guide and configuration files

## Development Priorities
1. Core OCR pipeline must be rock-solid
2. Embedding quality is critical for retrieval accuracy
3. RAG responses must include accurate citations
4. System must be observable with proper logging
5. API must be well-documented and testable

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement multiple OCR fallback options
- Cache embeddings aggressively to reduce costs
- Use connection pooling for database efficiency
- Implement circuit breakers for external services
- Create comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
